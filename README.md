Loadout
=======

Have you ever wished for a better favorites system? Have you ever been struggling with changing weapons or even apparel in combat? Then Loadout is a lightweight plugin that you will definitely enjoy. It allows you to store 10 unique sets of your complete outfit including weapons, spells and shouts and swap to them without interruption using hotkeys. The old favorites system can be used in combination with Loadout.
