Confirmed the EquipItem problem, started [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/articles/1152/]a petition[/url]. Trying to contact Bethesda and SKSE authors because the problem can't be solved in papyrus. Added version check for SKSE because a lot of people were saying that Loadout could only save, most of the time this is because they have an old SKSE version.

I gained access to a PS3 controller and installed MotioninJoy to simulate a 360 controller on my PC to test my code. Using a controller with Loadout is now possible:
 - Save to loadout 1: Right analog stick + D-pad left
 - Save to loadout 1: Right analog stick + D-pad right
 - Equip loadout 1: D-pad left
 - Equip loadout 2: D-pad right

[i][color=#c2c2c2]Summary:[/color][/i]
Disabled hotkeys when the game is paused which means that they dont work anymore in menus that pause the game. Testing xbox controller support since I have no controller to test it myself:
 - Save to loadout 1: Left analog stick + D-pad left (Didn't work because of Input.isKeyPressed bug)
 - Save to loadout 2: Left analog stick + D-pad right (Didn't work because of Input.isKeyPressed bug)
 - Equip loadout 1: D-pad left
 - Equip loadout 2: D-pad right
