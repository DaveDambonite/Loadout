# Loadout 0.11
Discovered the equipItem problem. Trying to contact Bethesda and SKSE authors because the problem can't be solved in papyrus. 
Added version check for SKSE because a lot of people were saying that Loadout could only save, most of the time this is because they have an old SKSE version. 

# Loadout 0.10
I gained access to a PS3 controller and installed MotioninJoy to simulate a 360 controller on my PC to test my code. 
Using a controller with Loadout is now possible:
  Save to loadout 1: Right analog stick + D-pad left
  Save to loadout 1: Right analog stick + D-pad right
  Equip loadout 1: D-pad left
  Equip loadout 2: D-pad right

# Loadout 0.09
Disabled hotkeys when the game is paused which means that they dont work anymore in menus that pause the game. 
Testing xbox controller support:
  Save to loadout 1: Left analog stick + D-pad left
  Save to loadout 2: Left analog stick + D-pad right
  Equip loadout 1: D-pad left
  Equip loadout 2: D-pad right
