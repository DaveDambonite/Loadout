[b][color=#d57c1d]Loadout 2.0.0[/color][/b]
[i][color=#cc122b]Warning:[/color][/i] You have to follow the upgrade guide if you used an earlier version of Loadout to ensure your wellbeing!
[i][color=#c2c2c2]Summary:[/color][/i]
I have done a complete rewrite of Loadout because I finally have time for it, hurray for hollidays! Now, Loadout uses the new SKSE functionality that allows plugins to recognize small differences in items better. Items with the same base item but a different name will now be correctly distinguished from eachother. If you have a mod that allows you to wear multiple similar items such as rings there might be a small bug that causes Loadout to fail unequipping those items correctly. This currently cannot be fixed without further help of SKSE. It is extremely unlikely that it will affect your gameplay because if you can equip multiple items, you probably will! With the rewrite I have introduced some small optimizations. 

I have changed the bind loadout hotkey modifier to CTRL instead of ALT because I wanted to be able to switch loadouts in combat where I have to use ALT in order to run. Since sneaking is toggled, in contrast with running which is done by holding, you can still switch loadouts while sneaking without accidentally saving a loadout. 
[i][color=#c2c2c2]Changes:[/color][/i]
[img]http://oi45.tinypic.com/290smkx.jpg[/img] Uses item type as well as item name recognition and therefore now allows you to have a loadout with a Gold Ring of Health and a different loadout with a Gold Ring of Stamina for example. 
[img]http://oi45.tinypic.com/290smkx.jpg[/img] Changed 'save' hotkey to CTRL + 0-9 instead of ALT + 0-9
[img]http://oi45.tinypic.com/290smkx.jpg[/img] Use regular Arrays instead of FormLists and wrote all the code in a single script for increased performance

[i][color=#c2c2c2]Summary:[/color][/i]
Loadout now properly unequips items and spells held in the hands like it already did for apparel, shouts and powers. There is no need to update if you explicitly used the old behavior. This update allows you to create a 'bare handed fighter' loadout for example.

[i][color=#c2c2c2]Summary:[/color][/i]
Multiple people reported that Loadout stopped working for them after the first time. This is a test version of Loadout that registers the keyboard/gamepad events every time you load a savegame. I also added additional debug statements. Enable debugging with the help of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/articles/1219]this guide[/url].

Fixed a problem where the Loadout quest wouldn't start when beginning a new adventure. [url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2973655]The phenomenon[/url] is known as the 'Dialog bug'. Save and load the game once after your hands are freed.

[i][color=#c2c2c2]Summary:[/color][/i]
Hosted Loadout on github. Created building tools with nodejs that I can trigger with Sublime Text 2. Did a complete rewrite of the equipment saving and restoring mechanics. Split the main script into Loadout specific code and a utility script. 
[i][color=#c2c2c2]Changes:[/color][/i]
[img]http://oi45.tinypic.com/290smkx.jpg[/img] Hosted the [url=https://github.com/DaveDambonite/Loadout]source code[/url]

[img]http://oi45.tinypic.com/290smkx.jpg[/img] Only the necessary changes are made now when restoring a loadout

[b][color=#d57c1d]Loadout 0.11[/color][/b]
[i][color=#c2c2c2]Summary:[/color][/i]
Confirmed the EquipItem problem, started [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/articles/1152/]a petition[/url]. Trying to contact Bethesda and SKSE authors because the problem can't be solved in papyrus. Added version check for SKSE because a lot of people were saying that Loadout could only save, most of the time this is because they have an old SKSE version. 
[i][color=#c2c2c2]Changes:[/color][/i]

[i][color=#c2c2c2]Summary:[/color][/i]
I gained access to a PS3 controller and installed MotioninJoy to simulate a 360 controller on my PC to test my code. Using a controller with Loadout is now possible:
 - Save to loadout 1: Right analog stick + D-pad left
 - Save to loadout 1: Right analog stick + D-pad right
 - Equip loadout 1: D-pad left
 - Equip loadout 2: D-pad right
[i][color=#c2c2c2]Changes:[/color][/i]
[img]http://oi45.tinypic.com/290smkx.jpg[/img] Added gamepad controls


[b][color=#d57c1d]Loadout 0.09[/color][/b]
[i][color=#c2c2c2]Summary:[/color][/i]
Disabled hotkeys when the game is paused which means that they dont work anymore in menus that pause the game. Testing xbox controller support since I have no controller to test it myself:
 - Save to loadout 1: Left analog stick + D-pad left (Didn't work because of Input.isKeyPressed bug)
 - Save to loadout 2: Left analog stick + D-pad right (Didn't work because of Input.isKeyPressed bug)
 - Equip loadout 1: D-pad left
 - Equip loadout 2: D-pad right
